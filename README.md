# Toolkit

Welcome to a curated list of my favorite pieces of software for macOS and Windows! I've been exploring interesting software for years, and I've finally gotten to a stage where almost every aspect of my macOS and Windows experience is decently optimized. This list will include exhaustive information about software, including alternatives to my solutions, amazing features in certain pieces of software, and how to make my solutions even better with the power of customization.

This symbol (<img src="/opensource.png" height="17">) represents free, open-source software. Not everything on this list is FOSS, but everything is free and widely available for download.

# Browsers

### My primary browser recommendation for all platforms: Zen Browser <img src="/opensource.png" height="17">

### My secondary browser recommendation for macOS: Google Chrome

### My secondary browser recommendation for Windows: Microsoft Edge

Most of the time I spend on a computer involves browsing the web. As such, finding an excellent web browser is an important task, but it's also an extremely difficult one, especially given the wide variety of options.

First, I need to talk about Brave. Choosing Brave has always seemed extremely unnecessary. It's literally a worse version of Chrome, designed for people who are overly neurotic about privacy. On first launch, it's an unusable browser, thanks to the crypto features. Then, once you disable all of the crypto garbage, it upgrades from being unusable to being pretty bad. The "privacy" features that the Brave team has implemented are great for privacy, but they break numerous websites and make life difficult for web developers. The adblocking features, on the other hand, are effective, but they don't incentivize me whatsoever to choose Brave over other browsers. In other browsers, uBlock Origin can replicate the functionality, and I don't even use Brave's adblocking features. Since I install uBlock Origin in Brave as well, I usually disable the Brave adblocking features so that they don't combat the uBO ones; uBlock Origin has always worked well (better than Brave's built-in ones) for privacy and for adblocking, and in my eyes, there's no need for the extra privacy given by Brave. It's also important to note that Brave doesn't even have that much better performance than Chrome, and in my experience, Chrome's Memory Saver feature has been far superior to Brave's alternative. This is especially important for people who regularly have hundreds of tabs open. Simply put, the only reason anyone would choose Brave over Chrome is if they're overly neurotic about security. Aside from the adblocking, privacy, crypto, and AI features, Brave also has some other unique features that Chrome doesn't have (like vertical tabs), but there are better alternatives, so I don't think these are good incentives to use Brave (more on this later). The last nail in the coffin is that I find Brave rather unpleasant to look at. These are two excellent articles that talk about why Brave's crypto breaches the company's whole privacy mission and how Brave - the company - is going in the completely wrong direction: [(A)](https://www.xda-developers.com/brave-most-overrated-browser-dont-recommend/) [(B)](https://www.spacebar.news/stop-using-brave-browser/).

Zen Browser is my primary browser recommendation. Zen is FOSS, and it fills more boxes than any other browser out there. Zen is an Arc-inspired, Firefox-based browser, and apart from the fact that it uses Gecko, it's great. Even though I don't use a lot of Zen's coolest features, I have had no problems whatsoever with the ones that I use - Glance has come in handy, especially for links I'm clicking in Gmail, and I love the Arc-inspired design of Zen.

Microsoft Edge used to be terrible, but it's my recommendation for Windows secondary browser.

Arc was a great browser for macOS. As for Windows, well, not so much. Either way, it's not a suitable choice in the status quo because The Browser Company has completely stopped development on Arc in favor of their AI-garbage browser, Dia. The vision for Arc is still great, and it inspires Zen, but I see no world where Arc is an acceptable browser, especially given the macOS battery issues.



# Browser Extensions

### My recommendations for Chromium-based browsers:

### My recommendations for Firefox-based browsers:

Using the right extensions is really important for a good browsing experience, and my recommendations in the Browsers section assume that you're using certain extensions - otherwise, the list would likely be different.

For Chromium-based browsers, understanding that Manifest v2 is being deprecated is extremely important. The Chromium team has rolled out the decision to prevent Manifest v2 extensions from being utilized, meaning that many of our favorite extensions (most notably, uBlock Origin) no longer work on Chrome. Some Chromium forks, like Edge and Brave, plan to roll out this change "on a future date," whatever that means.
